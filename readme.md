# Text Your Mom!

Oh boy! Never forget to text your mom when traveling.

    Q: Do we really need an app for that?
    A: Ask your mom.

## Wut?

Receive push notifications straight to your phone when you land at a new destination. The app uses your location in the background and when you appear at an airport, you get a notification.

## Not available on App Store

This is a small hackathon project created during my stay in [http://thesurfoffice.com](http://thesurfoffice.com). [Peter's](https://twitter.com/faborio) idea, [David's](https://dribbble.com/stefooo) design and my poor swift coding. This was my first Swift/iPhone project. My goal was to learn something new. Unfortunately the project wasn't accepted to the App Store because we use location services "without a purpose". The purpose is clear in our opinion, but we are geeks ;)

The conclusion is that I didn't become a big fan of iPhone development. Yes, I'm looking at you Apple.
